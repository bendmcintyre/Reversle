Reversle

Inspiration:

    I plan on creating a reverse Wordle game.
    The user will choose a letter and place it in a spot to create a 5 letter word.
    The trick is, once they place a letter in a spot 1-5, they cannot move it when the next letter pops up.
    It then creates a challenge to guess where all 5 letters can go to make a 5 letter word.
